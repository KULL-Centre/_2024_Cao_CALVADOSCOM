# CALVADOS 3

This repository contains codes, raw data and parameter files that used to reproduce the results in [A coarse-grained model for disordered and multi-domain proteins
](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.03.578735v2).

We note that the current version of CALVADOS 3 (src/residues_pub.csv), as described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.03.578735v2, differs from the version described in our original preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.03.578735v1). We recommend users to use the current CALVADOS 3 parameters, and to refer to the original version (src/residues_pub_beta.csv) as CALVADOS 3beta.   

## Layout

`data/`: raw data used for making figures in the paper; 

`paper_multidomainCALVADOS/`: figures (pdf format) in the paper; 

`src/`: all codes, starting conformations of multi-doamin proteins and experimental data used to reproduce results contained in the paper;

`src/BLOCKING/`: tools for assessing convergence of Molecular Dynamics simulations (https://github.com/fpesceKU/BLOCKING);

`src/expPREs/`: paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR data for optimization;

`src/extract_relax`: Initial conformations of multi-domain proteins for simulations;

`src/domains.yaml`: Domain boundaries of used multi-domain proteins in this study;

`src/residues_pub.csv`: parameters file containing CALVADOS 1, CALVADOS 2 and CALVADOS 3;

`figures.ipynb`: jupyter version of plotting;



## Use

To use this repository:
1. download and unzip it; 
2. create a conda environment with the following command. (alternative: install packages separately by `pip` or `conda`; you can skip installing `deerpredict` package if you only need simulations not optimizations);

    ``conda env create -f environment.yaml``

    then activate the environment:

    ``conda activate CALVADOS3``

4. (optional, only for optimization) install `pulchra` (https://www.pirx.com/pulchra/) and assign its absolute path to `path2pulchra` in `src/submit_ray.py`;
 

## Run single-chain simulations with CALVADOS 3:
👋 Please go for `src/simple_singlechain.py` if you are interested in running single-chain simulation with CALVADOS3 in a simpler way 👋. (compared with using `src/submit_ray.py` and following the instructions below)

Follow 1-4 if your protein is a multi-domain protein; only follow 1 and 4 if it is a intrinsically disordered protein;
1. decide a proper protein name (`pro_name`) to avoid conflict with existing proteins;
2. insert the protein structure file (must be `.pdb`, the `resSeq` should start from `1`) into `/src/extract_relax` directory with a nomenclature as `${pro_name}_rank0_relax.pdb`;
3. determine the domain boundaries of the protein. Each domain is restrained separately. For example, 
```
Ubq2 has two domains; one is from 11th to 82th residue; the other one is from 87th to 158th residue (counting from 1).
Ubq2:
  - [11,82]
  - [87,158]
```
```
S4FL has two domains; one is from 15th to 138th residue; 
the other one has 3 parts because we are excluding long loops between them. 3 parts are still restrained together.  
S4FL:
  - [15,138]
  - [[287,294],[323,466],[492,542]]
```
4. add two new lines in `rawdata.py` with formats of
```
fasta_${pro_name} = "${protein_sequence_oneletter}"
proteins.loc['${pro_name}'] = dict(temp=${experimental_temperate}, expRg=${experimental_Rg}, expRgErr=${experimental_RgErr}, pH=${experimental_pH}, fasta=list(fasta_${pro_name}), ionic=${experimental_ionic)}
# if you don't have to compare with experimental data, please set "expRg" and "expRgErr" to None. It won't raise errors for simulations, but will for optimization
```

The new lines should be in `initIDPsRgs` function under `if validate:` condition if it is a intrinsically disordered protein; 

The new lines should be in `initMultiDomainsRgs` function under `if validate:` condition if it is a multi-domain protein.

5. modify `/src/submit_ray.py` as you want and submit jobs by
```
python3 submit_ray.py
```
## Run multi-chain simulations with CALVADOS 3:
1. make sure the single-chain simulations of your interested proteins have been finished;
2. pick the most compact conformation (smallest Rg) from single-chain trajectories and save it under `src/extract_relax` as `${pro_name}_${CG}_ini.pdb`. `CG` is the coarse-grained method (CA, COM or SCCOM);
3. add experimental data to `src/csat_calvados2_test.csv` (if IDP) or `src/csat_MDPs_test.csv` (if MDP);
4. modify `/src/submit_slab.py` as you want and submit jobs by
```
python3 submit_slab.py
```
## Reproduce optimization results:
Please check the details in `src/submit_ray.py`;
